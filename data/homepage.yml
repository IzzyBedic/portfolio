  title: "Who am I?"
  content: 
    <p class="lead">
    I am a big nature-lover! From pre-K to my senior year of high school
    I never missed a year of farm camp. Something about sleeping outside made 
    waking up at 4am to start chores <i>fun</i>. I have also backpacked a couple 
    sections of the PCT! A large part of my motivation for a career in data 
    science is the ability to really see the factors helping and hurting our
    natural world. I hope to contribute to scientific discoveries and policy 
    changes to help save the outdoors and its constituents.
